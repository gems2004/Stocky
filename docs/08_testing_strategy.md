# Testing Strategy

## Testing Principles
- Write tests early and often
- Maintain high code coverage (>80%)
- Use both unit and integration tests
- Automate testing where possible
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on business logic
- Fast execution

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between components
- Test API endpoints with database
- Test frontend-backend integration
- Verify data flow

### End-to-End Tests
- Simulate real user scenarios
- Test complete workflows
- Validate UI interactions
- Test cross-component functionality

### Performance Tests
- Measure response times
- Test concurrent user loads
- Identify bottlenecks
- Validate scalability

## Backend Testing

### Technologies
- Pytest for unit testing
- Django Test Client for API testing
- PostgreSQL test database for tests

### Test Areas
- Model validation
- API endpoint responses
- Authentication/authorization
- Data processing logic
- Error handling

### Example Test Scenarios
- Creating a product with valid data
- Handling invalid product creation requests
- Searching products by various criteria
- Processing a POS transaction
- Applying discounts correctly
- Inventory level adjustments
- User authentication flows

## Frontend Testing

### Technologies
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

### Test Areas
- Component rendering
- User interactions
- State management
- API integration
- Routing with Next.js

### Example Test Scenarios
- Product list displays correctly
- Form validation works properly
- Shopping cart updates correctly
- POS checkout flow
- Navigation between pages
- Error message display

## Database Testing
- Schema validation
- Data integrity checks
- Migration testing
- Performance with large datasets

## Security Testing
- Authentication validation
- Authorization checks
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention

## Testing Tools
- Pytest: Python testing framework
- Django Test Client: Django testing utilities
- Jest: JavaScript testing framework
- React Testing Library: React component testing
- Cypress: End-to-end testing
- ESLint: Code quality checks
- Prettier: Code formatting consistency

## CI/CD Integration
- Run tests on every commit
- Automated test reports
- Block deployments on test failures
- Monitor test coverage
